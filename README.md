# Cruise-Booking-Price-Prediction

This data-driven project explores the world of cruise booking price prediction, harnessing various regression techniques and robust data analysis. The journey begins with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), showing valuable insights and addressing missing data points. The dataset is cleaned and transformed to prepare it for modeling.

The project showcases the power of regression models, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and XGBoost Regression, to predict cruise booking prices with precision. To combat overfitting and optimize model performance, Ridge Factorization is applied. Following extensive model evaluation, the best-performing regression model is identified, with key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) presented.

One of the project's highlights is the selection of the best-performing model, which, in this case, is Polynomial Regression with a degree of 3. It achieves an impressive R2 score of 0.95, indicating its superior predictive capabilities. Furthermore, the project offers business recommendations based on these insights. These include optimizing pricing strategies, enhancing the cruise booking experience, and tailoring marketing efforts to specific customer segments. By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders in the cruise industry can unlock substantial revenue growth potential.

# Business Recommendations Summary

Booking Lead Time Matters: Encourage early bookings with discounts or promotions to increase revenue, as longer booking lead times tend to result in higher prices paid for cruises.

Cabin Type Impact: Optimize pricing strategies for different cabin types based on their popularity. Consider promotions or packages for less popular cabins to boost their appeal to customers.

Duration and Price Relationship: Investigate non-linear relationships between cruise duration and price to further understand their connection.

Customer Group Size: Develop targeted marketing strategies or loyalty programs to attract larger booking groups, as they tend to pay slightly higher prices.

Interpreting Differences: Recognize that popularity and revenue don't always align. Routes with fewer bookings may still yield substantial revenue if they cater to a premium clientele. Strategic decisions should balance popularity and revenue potential.
